# semantic-segmentation-adaptive-manipulation
This project presents the development of a flexible robotic manipulation system based on computer vision, aimed at industrial applications. The main goal is to identify and locate objects through instance segmentation and automatically determine their pose (position and orientation) to enable their manipulation by a robotic arm.
